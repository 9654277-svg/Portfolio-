### Calculator (2025)

This project is a fully functional GUI-based calculator built in Processing, a Java-based creative coding environment. The calculator features a clean interface and supports various arithmetic and scientific operations, showcasing object-oriented programming principles, custom UI component creation, and real-time interaction.

   ### If Statements (2025)
This Processing sketch demonstrates the use of if and else if statements to calculate and display a letter grade based on a numeric value controlled by the mouse position. As the user moves the mouse horizontally across the screen, the program converts the mouse’s x-coordinate into a grade value and displays it above the cursor. The calcGrade() function checks this value against a grading scale and assigns the appropriate letter grade (A through F).

### BallBounce (2025)
The Ball class defines a simple moving ball with a position, size, and speed. The ball is drawn as a gray ellipse using the display() method and moves horizontally by updating its x-position in the move() method.

### Group project Game (DIGIPETS) (2025)

This project was built in Processing, a Java-based creative coding enviroment. the game showcases coding with a group and it is called Digipets. Digipets is a game where you can clean, play and take care of a pet. it shows different parts of coding and is a custom UI component creation, and real-time interactions.
